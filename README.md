Code used to find the optimal friction coefficient in a Lagrangian model of a pendulum system

Mathematical data modelling project term 2. 

30.02 (Monday) - created first mask, run the script for the first time, added picture saving, obtained 10 pictures (first run)
02.02 (Thursday) - increased frame rate, improved the mask, pictures now taken in time interval, obtained 40 images (second run) and 99 pictures (third run)

TODO: Increase frame rate (doesn't catch the motion of the ball at its fastest velocity
